# ðŸ’¾ neovim config

_it configures neovim_

### Setup

First, install Neovim.

```
brew install neovim
```

Also, install `ripgrep`, a dependency of Telescope.

```
brew install ripgrep
```

Then, clone this repository into your `~/.config` directory.
On first starting neovim with `nvim`, `lazy.nvim` will install itself and all
necessary plugins (not LSPs, formatters, or linters -- use `:Mason` for that).

### Acknowledgments

h/t to YouTube user [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) for his awesome [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn) on getting set up in
neovim, which I followed pretty closely as I was getting started.
